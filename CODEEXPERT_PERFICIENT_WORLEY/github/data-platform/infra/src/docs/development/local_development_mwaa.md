# MWAA Local Development
You can develop MWAA DAGs by using MWAA local runner. The following [repository](https://github.com/aws/aws-mwaa-local-runner) provides a command line interface (CLI) utility that replicates an Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) environment locally.

## Instructions
To avoid repetition, please refer to the README file in the [aws-mwaa-local-runner](https://github.com/aws/aws-mwaa-local-runner) repository. In a nutshell, you will need `Docker` installed in your local environment.

## Accessing AWS Resources
Please note that your local environment will require appropiate access to AWS resources. Please follow the instructions in the official [Airflow Documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-amazon/stable/connections/aws.html) page to use your AWS credentials with local MWAA

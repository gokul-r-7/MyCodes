## Usage
The Worley Data Platform provides a robust and flexible infrastructure for managing your data lakes on AWS. Some key usage scenarios include:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Easily ingest data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, and event streams, into your data lakes.
2. **Data Processing and Transformation**: Leverage the power of AWS services like AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, and Amazon EMR to transform and prepare your data for analysis.
3. **Data Exploration and Analytics**: Utilize Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon QuickSight to explore and analyze the data stored in your data lakes.
4. **Data Governance and Security**: Ensure data security and compliance through features like AWS Lake Formation, AWS Glue Data Catalog, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
5. **Scalability and Elasticity**: Dynamically scale your data platform infrastructure to accommodate changing data volumes and processing requirements.

For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the project's documentation and tutorials.



## Deployment
The Worley Data Platform is designed to be deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform. The Terraform configuration files, located in the project's root directory, define the necessary AWS resources and their configurations.

To deploy the Worley Data Platform to your AWS environment, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the latest version of Terraform installed and configured with your AWS credentials.
2. Review and customize the Terraform configuration files to match your specific requirements, such as resource sizes, data lake locations, and security settings.
3. Run the Terraform `apply` command to provision the infrastructure:
```bash
terraform apply
```
4. Verify the deployment by checking the output of the Terraform apply process and exploring the provisioned resources in the AWS Management Console.
5. Optionally, configure any additional integrations or customizations required for your specific use case.

Hii Team,

I met with an accident on Dec 13, 2022 my left hip joint (Left Neck of Femur Bone) was completely fractured. I had my first surgery on Dec 14, 2022. In my recent checkup my doctor confirmed Nonunion of bone due to Avascular Necrosis (Death of Bone tissue due to lack of blood supply). My doctor planning for another surgery. So I decided to take a break in my career untill I recover completely.

Kindly please give me immediate release. Iâ€™ve attached all the medical reports.

Thanks,
Gokul
